## MarkovDistinction: Distortion Image Generator

### How to Set Up and Run the Code

1. Clone your project to your IDE
2. Using Terminal/Command Prompt, go to the directory for this project
3. Run the project using 'python3 imageGenerator.py'
4. The program will ask for a random number between 1 and 15.
5. Let the program run, **it may take some time**.

### Project Description

  This program generates an image with a fractal-like nature and is distorted, recolored, and magnified depending
  on the user's input (between 1 and 15) which will trigger a sequence of more integers/config. to dictate the        overall attributes of the image. This doesn't mean that only 15 images can be generated. This means there are 15    initial states that diverge and interact with other configurations using the probability table to multiply the      number of possible images to be generated.

  #### Meaning?

  As an artist, I enjoy drawing pieces that are non-object, abstract, and obscure to the human eye. I enjoy that my 
  pieces puzzle people into questioning if there's a deeper meaning in such elaborate pieces. This wasn't my 
  initial idea when deciding what to work on. I instead decided to try to imitate art created by a person (me) 
  which is non-objective with no particular purpose, yet elaborate and complicated.

  #### Challenging?
  
  I found this project difficult in a different manner than other (challenging) projects in my past. When I started   (with a different idea), realized I had constrained myself to the concern of implementation It wasn't until I let   go of this concern that my interests merged. I had to dedicate my artistic knowledge and preference in addition 
  to constraints inherent to coding. I had to think of the colors that would best complement each other and use       this data to create the probability matrix in such a way that certain colors and the use of space have a higher     probability of being chosen. This challenge (and prompt) gave me an opportunity to, at last, see an intersection    between my visual art, and my capability to implement such a request. Going forward, I plan on learning more 
  about the different dynamics and moving parts in the system in order to be more in control of the outcome. 
  However, one of the biggest strengths of this program is its unpredictability.

  #### Creative?
  **I would consider this system to be creative** for its ability to create detailed images using very little user 
  input and for the reason that it fulfills my unique need for artistic inspiration for obscure art. Although I 
  consult the internet to find the mathematical operations needed to create a singular fractal image, this system     extends beyond the limitations of the mathematical model to generate many different images with irregular shapes and little relation to the original image.
