## MarkovDistinction: Distortion Image Generator

### How to Set Up and Run the Code

1. Clone your project to your IDE
2. Using Terminal/Command Prompt, go to the directory for this project
3. Run the project using 'python3 imageGenerator.py'
4. The program will ask for a random number between 1 and 15.
5. Let the program run, **it may take some time**.

### Project Description

  This program generates an image with a fractal-like nature and is distorted, recolored and magnified dependeing
  on the user's input (between 1 - 15) which will trigger a sequence of more integer/config. to dictate the overall   attributes of the image. This doesn't mean that only 15 images can be generated. This means there are 15 initital   states which diverage and interact with other configurations using the probability table to multiply the number     of possible images to be generated
