## MarkovDistinction: Distortion Image Generator

### How to Set Up and Run the Code

1. Clone your project to your IDE
2. Using Terminal/Command Prompt, go to the directory for this project
3. Run the project using 'python3 imageGenerator.py'
4. The program will ask for a random number between 1 and 15.
5. Let the program run, **it may take some time**.

### Project Description

  This program generates an image with a fractal-like nature and is distorted, recolored, and magnified depending
  on the user's input (between 1 and 15) which will trigger a sequence of more integers/config. to dictate the        overall attributes of the image. This doesn't mean that only 15 images can be generated. This means there are 15    initial states that diverge and interact with other configurations using the probability table to multiply the      number of possible images to be generated

  #### Meaning

  As an artist, I enjoy drawing pieces that are non-object, abstract, and obscure to the human eye. I enjoy that my 
  pieces puzzle people into questioning if there's a deeper meaning in such elaborate pieces. This wasn't my 
  initial idea when deciding what to work on. I instead decided to try to imitate art created by a person (me) 
  which is non-objective with no particular purpose, yet elaborate and complicated.
